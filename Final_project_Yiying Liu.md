# Final Project
  My final project's idea is from my summer internship company: Biomotivate. The company is focus on addiction treatment and recovery process.
  For this project, I will show people that drug abuse is a serious and nationwide problem and most traditional treatment centers do not provide effective treatments to patients. I will present my project from these perspective:
  * Description of the basic situation and background on drug abuse and treatment centers
    * Categorized data: based on states; Drug types; ages; genders on deaths rate, drop out rate and drug use rate
    * Expenditure data for government, family and person
  * Three stories from drug abuse users. (Use plot to show their life stories)
  * Summarize some common factors that would influence people's craving level and bring up the hypothesis.
  * Solutions based on our company's idea: a digital motivation platform using human computer interaction data, digital dashboards and predictive algorithms to help people stay sober from substance use disorders.
  * Dicuss other exsiting and potential solutions and future prospect of the industry.   

## Initial sketches
Here is my initial thoughts and some chart type I might choose in my final project. I want to emphasize the User stories part, since it would be powerful and easily to bond with audience.

## Data Source and Method 
For the qantitative data set, I will grasp different data set from many websites. There are some sources I would like to use:
  * Background and basic description:
    * Substance Abuse Statistics by State: https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/opioids/opioid-summaries-by-state
    * Costs of Substance Abuse; Nationwide Alcohol and Drug Trends; Substance Abuse Treatment
 https://drugabuse.com/statistics-data/
    * Overdose Death Rates
  https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates
    * Basic descrption:
  https://americanaddictioncenters.org/rehab-guide/addiction-statistics
For the stories, I will summarize and rewrite the real stories we interviewed before during my intern. There are most sad stories, and I will hide their personal information to ensure they will not be identified.   
For the solutions and prospect, I plan to summarize the existing data and result from our company's report and some ideas. 

### Method
I plan to use shorthand to create a web page. Morevoer, I will also combine all the tools and platform we have learned from the class to help my project.
