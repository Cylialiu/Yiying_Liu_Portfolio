# Final Project
  My final project's idea is from my summer internship company: Biomotivate. The company is focus on addiction treatment and recovery process.
  For this project, I will show people that drug abuse is a serious and nationwide problem and most traditional treatment centers do not provide effective treatments to patients. I will present my project from these perspective:
  * Description of the basic situation and background on drug abuse and treatment centers
    * Categorized data: based on states; Drug types; ages; genders on deaths rate, drop out rate and drug use rate
    * Expenditure data for government, family and person
  * Three stories from drug abuse users. (Use plot to show their life stories)
  * Summarize some common factors that would influence people's craving level and bring up the hypothesis.
  * Solutions based on our company's idea: a digital motivation platform using human computer interaction data, digital dashboards and predictive algorithms to help people stay sober from substance use disorders.
  * Dicuss other exsiting and potential solutions and future prospect of the industry.
