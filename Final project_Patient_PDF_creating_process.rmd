## Main Visualization Part 2: Customized personal monthly/weekly data visualization
As one of the most important part of the solution: an innovative platform tracking the key personal physical signals to help customers to learn their behavioral and physiological patterns, so that they (and their support networks) know when they need additional internal and external motivation. We plan to utilize sleep, motion and physiological data to identify risk and create a proactive early warning system to prevent relapse.   


Considering our product is still under research and design process, I did not get the "real data" from customers. All the data I use for this project are "test data" created by myself. The purpose is to show the user interface design for the monthly data learning process and weekly report for our customers. We plan to create the report based on customers' personal data and send them by email or send to their treatment center. Based on their weekly data and performance, the customers or their supporters could consider some changes for next week in order to stay sober for a longer time.

Many papers point out that stress level, plays a significant role in interacting with multiple social, individual and biological factors which impact addiction recovery process[Rajita Sinha,2009](https://www.ncbia.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2734447/). Moreover, many researchers prove that EDA(Electrodermal activity) is excellent in assessing stress level. In 2017, [Roberto Zangróniz](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/17/10/2324/pdf)and his team found out that the wearable device solely based on EDA signal reports 89% accuracy when distinguishing calm condition from distress condition. By using wearable devices and analyse customer's EDA data and other physical signals to predict potential relapse risk, and provide customized precaution measurements is the main idea for our solution.

However, there are too many potential signals, for this project, I just chose the three most important ones: sleep, steps and  manually entered mood data, to show the possible raltionship with EDA. 

### First version of the PDF report from our design team
This version is designed from our design team and we collected some feedback by interviewing treatment center patients, threapsit, addiction user family members and other people. Based on all these feedbacks, I recreated the main chart of the pdf and hope it could be a useful comteporary for the main PDF report. 

#### First version:

<img width="568" alt="1st version 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51921356/62174412-dd45e880-b307-11e9-9a47-2f4eeb774bdf.PNG">
<img width="539" alt="1 version 3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51921356/62174413-dd45e880-b307-11e9-9893-98f7d10c6282.PNG">

Basically, the weekly report contains the key signals for customer's week performance, including, heartrate, sleep data, steps, EDA. Based on all these infor, we provide some suggestions at the last part. 

### Research Protocol
In order to have a better understanding of the what contents and style of visualization wouuld be more useful for our targets, we asked those questions:
1. How often would you say you normally go on the internet?
2. What’s the biggest challenge about being in recovery?
3. What sorts of things make it easier?
4. What do you like best about this product?
7.Is the meaning of each picture clear to you? What kind of information can you get when you first see that?
8. How did you like the way the text was phrased?
9. Do you think this product would be helpful to you?
10. Is there anything missing that you think would be useful?
11. Any changes you would make to it?

We got many informative and useful feedbacks from different targets. Here I list the ones I think are most helpful:
(All feedbacks are from our company internal note)
1. **Want to see that certain activities lead to reduced stress (meditation, dog walk, spiritual activities, therapy, breathing exercises, going to a narcotics meeting, going to church, eating well, exercising) - her friend ate poorly and didn’t exercise and watched too much TV and ended up relapsing even though he was going to meetings**  
I think it is a really good point that it is possible that there are some potential triggers of our stress level and cravings. Combining the specific daily activity with stress level would be important for people to figure out when they should pay attention, or what kind of activity would be helpful with their stress level decrease.  
2. **Fuse the sleep and heartrate and steps graphs with the stress graph, steps graph and sleep info alone isn’t useful unless it is tied to the stress ratings**     
This is definitely one of the pain point we should pay attention to. Since we are creating a special product for a group of people with special needs, our product should provide different report or weekly dashboard from normal wearable devices. Most times, people know if they slept well or walked a lot yesterday, but they may have no idea what the relationship between these activities and their stress level. My boss once gave us an example that a guy never notived that he always felt stressful when he talked with his mom. By utilizing the product, we want to find these kinds of "ignored risk" activities.  
3. **Want more specific sleep recommendations- don’t just say your sleep quality is improved, she wants to know why it is improved - maybe some activity led to it improving sleep. Also want focus on activities people can control**  
This feedback reminds me the idea my TA MattFochs' final project. He used Alluvial diagram to combine his sleep partern with his spending habit. Therefore, I consider if I can also try to combine the different signal with EDA by using alluvial diagram, which might be helpful to solve the problem. 

I randomly create some data on sleep hours, mood, Steps and ERV to show if this idea is more clear and helpful.

### Daily routine and EDA score
I classify the EDA score into 4 categories by rounding up or down for the closet level.

Based on this chart, maybe for the analyze and recommendataion part, we could say:
"Mediation and reading seem are most helpful for you to calm down. Homework and cources are likely to increase your stress level. Having dinner with family sometimes might also cause the your stress. " Maybe for his therapist, who gets the report could ask why he would feel stressful during the dinner, what happened. For the recommendation part, we could say something like" Try to do a meditation or chat with your friends when you feel stressful." or "After 45 minutes homework, why not try to read some novels". I think these customized suggestions would be helpful. Furthermore, I think in the future, it could also be applied in daily tracking process. If at some point, the device finds out the customer's EDA reaches to a particular point, the app could automatically suggests something " Have been doing housework for 30 minutes, why not try to go for a walk?".
