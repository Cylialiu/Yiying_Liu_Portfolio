# About me
Hello! My name is Yiying Liu. I am from China. I like to be referred to with she, her, and hers pronouns.I am heading to the second year MSPPM program. I plan to do a job with analysis and data when I graduate, whcih is the trend today.   
My favorite boy, book, movie, and pricture is _Harry Potter_!

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to combine data with design. I want to be **_an artist_** in the tech world!  
Moreover, since it is common that powerpoint making skill is one of the most important skills in work place, put the data visualiztion in my tool box would be pretty useful and amazing.   
Instead of using boring bullet points or monotomous pictures, I want to present my idea, project and work to my client and manager in a fresh way!

# Porfolio
Here is where all of my cool data visualizations will go!

##### Analysis
This inforgraphic covers the most important data that I think a "general audience" of Newsweek website would be interested. Here is my detailed analysis:  
* **"General audience"**: I define the general audience would be the readers of a news website: [Newsweek] (https://www.newsweek.com/). In my opinion, as readers of new media, most people would like to get the key information as soon as possible. Using attached inforgraphic, icons, emphasizing numbers in the article would be helpful for readers to understand and also catch their eyes or it also can be a berif summary of the article. 

* **Data choice**: The data I chose is that the section of "At-Risk Populations are Subject to Overcrowding and Prolonged Detention in Border Patrol Facilities". As a normal reader, they might have no understanding of the scale of "how many people across the boarder illegally". Instead, if provide some small daily issue, such as no access to shower, hot food, and being detention more than 7 days. 
The readers would understand the serious situation sooner and also arouse their sympathy. 

* **Color choice and composing:**
  * I use yellow, the bright color to attract reader's eyes and also a sign of emergency. Choose black color and white text show a good contrast with yellow and also emphase the most important content part.   
  * I use "child" icon and "shower, clothes, hot meals" icons. I think using simplify icons could express much information in a simple way and also leave people a clear impression. One thing I am not satisfied is that I tried to put the "delete icon" above the "shower" one, but it looks a chaos. I doubt the way I am using now might be misunderstood by so quick readers, but I have no idea how to fix it for now.
  * The background picture I chose from the Newsweek website and blur it, which could have a nice contrast with the context.

**Summary**: All in all, I create this inforgraphic in a freshing and "magazine" style and summary a part of data from the article.

##### Analysis
As an anlayst working for the DHS, I cover the most important data that I think should be put in the report or be presented to the government. Here is my detailed analysis:
* **"General audience"**: To make an inforgraph in a formal report for government staff, I think it is important to keep the style serious, clean and organized. Therefore, I use DHS logo to keep the graph professional. Moreover, for the context, I emphasize two main points: 1. To explain the situation is unprecedented, and our system is not equipped to accommodate this scale migration pattern. 2. To state that DHS has taken many effective steps to solve the humanitarian crsis. 

* **Data and chart choice** : Just like I stated above, I chose the data of "average amount of people a day crossed our Southern Border illegally" to show the serious situation. I use colunmn chart, which shows that increase clearly and I add text explanation, which would be a good complement with the report.

* **Color choice** : Too keep the whole style professional and consistent, I chose the “dark blue” in DHS' logo and use similar colors for other part. For the text part, I just use white to be a nice contrast of blue. I do not think a colorful color is appropriate for this situation. Keep simple is my idea. 

#### Compare / contrast
Since the audience of two situation are totally different and also for different purpose, I seprately chose different data set, color scheme and chart style. More colorful and lively for a website, but mor professional and simple for the government report. My concern is that my inforgraph is more like a sole summary, not a chart embeded in the article. I might prefer using them in a presentation. All in all, I did some research and tried some styles and I think these two are pretty appropriate.
