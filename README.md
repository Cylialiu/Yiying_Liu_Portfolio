# Yiying_Liu_Portfolio
This is my public porfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello! My name is Yiying Liu. I am from China. I like to be referred to with she, her, and hers pronouns.I am heading to the second year MSPPM program. I plan to do a job with analysis and data when I graduate, whcih is the trend today. 

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to combine data with design. I want to be **_an artist_** in the tech world!  
Moreover, since it is common that powerpoint making skill is one of the most important skills in work place, put the data visualiztion in my tool box would be pretty useful and amazing.   
Instead of using boring bullet points or monotomous pictures, I want to present my idea, project and work to my client and manager in a fresh way!

# Porfolio
Here is where all of my cool data visualizations will go!
