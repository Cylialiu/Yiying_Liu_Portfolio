# About me
Hello! My name is Yiying Liu. I am from China. I like to be referred to with she, her, and hers pronouns.I am heading to the second year MSPPM program. I plan to do a job with analysis and data when I graduate, whcih is the trend today.   
My favorite boy, book, movie, and pricture is _Harry Potter_!

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to combine data with design. I want to be **_an artist_** in the tech world!  
Moreover, since it is common that powerpoint making skill is one of the most important skills in work place, put the data visualiztion in my tool box would be pretty useful and amazing.   
Instead of using boring bullet points or monotomous pictures, I want to present my idea, project and work to my client and manager in a fresh way!

### OIG data visualization 
#### As a Data journalist

##### Analysis
This inforgraphic covers the most important data that I think a "general audience" of Newsweek website would be interested. Here is my detailed analysis:  
* **"General audience"**: I define the general audience would be the readers of a news website: [Newsweek] (https://www.newsweek.com/). In my opinion, as readers of new media, most people would like to get the key information as soon as possible. Using attached inforgraphic, icons, emphasizing numbers in the article would be helpful for readers to understand and also catch their eyes or it also can be a berif summary of the article. 

* **Data choice**: The data I chose is that the section of "At-Risk Populations are Subject to Overcrowding and Prolonged Detention in Border Patrol Facilities". As a normal reader, they might have no understanding of the scale of "how many people across the boarder illegally". Instead, if provide some small daily issue, such as no access to shower, hot food, and being detention more than 7 days. 
The readers would understand the serious situation sooner and also arouse their sympathy. 

* **Color choice and composing:**
  * I use yellow, the bright color to attract reader's eyes and also a sign of emergency. Choose black color and white text show a good contrast with yellow and also emphase the most important content part.   
  * I use "child" icon and "shower, clothes, hot meals" icons. I think using simplify icons could express much information in a simple way and also leave people a clear impression. One thing I am not satisfied is that I tried to put the "delete icon" above the "shower" one, but it looks a chaos. I doubt the way I am using now might be misunderstood by so quick readers, but I have no idea how to fix it for now.
  * The background picture I chose from the Newsweek website and blur it, which could have a nice contrast with the context.

**Summary**: All in all, I create this inforgraphic in a freshing and "magazine" style and summary a part of data from the article.

##### Analysis
As an anlayst working for the DHS, I cover the most important data that I think should be put in the report or be presented to the government. Here is my detailed analysis:
* **"General audience"**: To make an inforgraph in a formal report for government staff, I think it is important to keep the style serious, clean and organized. Therefore, I use DHS logo to keep the graph professional. Moreover, for the context, I emphasize two main points: 1. To explain the situation is unprecedented, and our system is not equipped to accommodate this scale migration pattern. 2. To state that DHS has taken many effective steps to solve the humanitarian crsis. 

* **Data and chart choice** : Just like I stated above, I chose the data of "average amount of people a day crossed our Southern Border illegally" to show the serious situation. I use colunmn chart, which shows that increase clearly and I add text explanation, which would be a good complement with the report.

* **Color choice** : Too keep the whole style professional and consistent, I chose the “dark blue” in DHS' logo and use similar colors for other part. For the text part, I just use white to be a nice contrast of blue. I do not think a colorful color is appropriate for this situation. Keep simple is my idea. 

#### Compare / contrast
Since the audience of two situation are totally different and also for different purpose, I seprately chose different data set, color scheme and chart style. More colorful and lively for a website, but mor professional and simple for the government report. My concern is that my inforgraph is more like a sole summary, not a chart embeded in the article. I might prefer using them in a presentation. All in all, I did some research and tried some styles and I think these two are pretty appropriate.

* **Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?**  
The first impression is that it is a comparison of job loss between Obama and Bush administration. The “Bikini” shape stood out to me, but since it is not like traditional column chart, it is a little bit confusing. I think they use the negative number to show the different trend worked really well, and also the potential meaning of the color “blue vs red” which points two parties. However, it took me some time to figure out the x-axis is at the top, and I need to read the chart from left to right. Since I am not familiar with the background, neither this new form chart, I think it is not obvious to see. I think I would use line chart to show the difference trend between two administrations, which is clear and simple.

* **Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?**  
Voters and politician. I think it is pretty effective to reaching the audience. Since it clearly shows the different job loss trend between Obama and Bush government. Based on the real data, they use the color, style and the negative number in a smart way, which presents a powerful positive idea on Obama government

* **Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)**  
This method is comprehensive and covers the main points of the data visualization. I think if only considering this chart, there are some derived meaning and also take advantage of these features to be a tool of politics, which means data visualization would not always be objective, different perspective would create different result. I think this one could be measured too. I want to change the type of chart to line chart and label would be more clear. Comparing with the measures from Good charts, this method is quite different and score-based. The process from Good charts are more feeling and subject-based. I think both are useful and have their advantages. I think if would be better if we can coombine these two. Firstly, we can use the Stephen Few's method to go through the points and give a score, and then based on these measures go back to the questions form Good Charts and give some reasons. 

#### My recreation 
![job loss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51921356/61310308-0c197600-a7c2-11e9-8d34-9d1e43850841.png)

Firstly, I changed the chart from colunn one to line chart. Since the point of the chart is to show the different trend along time,  period, using line chart would be better to show the trend than column.  
Secondly, I combine the two administration in one chart to show the difference in a clear way. Instead of using the exsit date, I changed to use the "1st month, 5th month" in the period we chose to compare. I also add the exact date at the beginning and the end of lines, which could provide clear information to people who are not familiar with background. I keep the color and negative number axis. These are great design, since most people think "increase line" means better!
All in all, I think after my change, the chart becomes clean and focus, which can show the points well.

## Week 3

[Week 3 project](/Portolio Supporter.md)

## Final Project
**Target Audience**
The target audience will be focus on two groups of people:
1.	Treatment centers in Greater Pittsburgh Region. 
There are more than 20 mature treatment centers in this area. Most of them are facing with problems on low customer retention, high staff turnover and are seeking more effective measurements for drug recovery. The technology could be used for in patient program to help therapist to track patients’ conditions more accurately and comprehensively. Discovering potential leaving early risk and signals, treatment staff could provide corresponding measures to patients.
2.	Post-rehab needs and drug addicts who did not enroll treatment centers in Greater Pittsburgh Region. 
For many addicts, treatment is a lifelong process, and getting out of rehab is just one step. However, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, between 40 and 60 percent of people recovering from drug addiction relapse.  Relapse is usually caused by exposure to people, places, things or emotions that remind people in recovery of substance abuse. These triggers cause intense craving or make people in recovery think they need drugs to cope.

Based on the statistics, citing data from the Pennsylvania Coroners Association, Allegheny County's 2015 fatal overdose rate from all drugs was 33.6 per 100,000 people, nearly double the national rate. In 2017 there are 5000 people in all of Pennsylvania who died from overdoses.  Many of them are lack of condition or with concerns in joining treatment centers. For example, most single mother addicts considering their children would not participate any treatments. The technology would combine with their self-report data creating a customized report to help them adjust their daily routine and stress level to keep sober on their own. 

**Final Thoughts**
The whole project is based on the idea from the start-up comapny I worked this summer. As a key of the product design and research: data visualization for personal weekly dashboard, I take the advantage of the course to brainstorm and tried different types of charts. I get a lot of help from Matt, our TA and get inspired for the final alluvial diagrams. I also ask many advice from my boss, collegues and also get a lot of feedbacks from the true drug users in the treatment centers throught interviews. All the ideas seems too new and too much for them to understand at this stage. However, as a CMU student, I believe technology and data will lead the trend, even the revolution in this relative traditional industry in the near future. 

The key change I made is that I tried to combine the physical data(like heartrate, steps or EDA score) with the daily activities helping people to figure out their own behavior patterns. There are some takeways,some concerns and future plans:
1. "Indivisualized" is the key word that many counselors mentioned. People vary largely, from background to personalities. It seems hard to use a common parttern to "predict" their future risk, or behavior change. That is the balance we keep finding. In one way, it used meachine learning with some "pattern" signals to track people's behavior. In the other way, we also create the whole idea based on the customized data and design. There is a long way we should go, but introducing the techonology into the drug addiction field is the future.  
2. The final alluvial diagram might be too complicated to understand especailly for new users. It is my biggest concern. 
3. Data and techonology is the trend, I believe. However, there are lots of things that data cannot tell. The most impressive I had with one of the counselor is that she mentioned many times, the patients do not need to tell her, she just knows that these people are not ready and will relapse some day in the future. She cannot explain clearly why she thought about that. It is a "human feeling" and "recognition" that neither machine or data could tell. That is why maybe doctors, teachers and other positions connecting with Human, cannot be replaced with robots. 
4. We want this would be a tool for treatment center and targets to refer. It is like the weather report. We all know it always make mistakes, but as a daily reference, we combine the result of weather report and our body feelings to decide if I need to wear more tomorrow morning. Any tool,app,or devices nowadays would not be irreplacable or essential. In the future, if just one person by using this tool to aviod his relapse, or aviod overdose, that would be our success. For us, it is just a one, but for him, his family that would be 100%.
