# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to combine data with design. I want to be **_an artist_** in the tech world!  
Moreover, since it is common that powerpoint making skill is one of the most important skills in work place, put the data visualiztion in my tool box would be pretty useful and amazing.   
Instead of using boring bullet points or monotomous pictures, I want to present my idea, project and work to my client and manager in a fresh way!

Here is where all of my cool data visualizations will go!
